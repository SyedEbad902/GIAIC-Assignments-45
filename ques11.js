// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var friendName = ["Ahmed", "Akber", "Amjad", "Ajmal", "Atif"];
console.log("My Friend ".concat(friendName[0], " is very kind and loyal"));
console.log("My Friend ".concat(friendName[1], " is very kind and loyal"));
console.log("My Friend ".concat(friendName[2], " is very kind and loyal"));
console.log("My Friend ".concat(friendName[3], " is very kind and loyal"));
console.log("My Friend ".concat(friendName[4], " is very kind and loyal"));
