// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendName: string[] = ["Ahmed", "Akber", "Amjad", "Ajmal", "Atif"];
console.log(`My Friend ${friendName[0]} is very kind and loyal`);
console.log(`My Friend ${friendName[1]} is very kind and loyal`);
console.log(`My Friend ${friendName[2]} is very kind and loyal`);
console.log(`My Friend ${friendName[3]} is very kind and loyal`);
console.log(`My Friend ${friendName[4]} is very kind and loyal`);
